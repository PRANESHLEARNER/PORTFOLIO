                <p>
                    Hello! I am a passionate **Full Stack Developer** currently pursuing a degree in **Information Science and Engineering (ISE) at Bannari Amman Institute**.
                    My primary goal is to **master full-stack development** while exploring **multiple problem-solving approaches** to build efficient and scalable applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have experience in **React.js, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB**, and I love working with new technologies to improve my skills.
                    Additionally, I have hands-on experience with **TensorFlow** for **image processing and machine learning**, particularly using the **MNIST dataset** for model training.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy participating in **competitive programming, image processing projects, and full-stack development**. I aim to build innovative applications that enhance user experience and solve real-world problems.</p>
