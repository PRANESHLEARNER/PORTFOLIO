                <p>
                    Hello! I am <strong>Vetrivel</strong>, a passionate <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Information Science and Engineering (ISE) at Bannari Amman Institute</strong>.
                    My primary goal is to <strong>master full-stack development</strong> while exploring <strong>multiple problem-solving approaches</strong> to build efficient and scalable applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have experience in <strong>React.js, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB</strong>, and I love working with new technologies to improve my skills.
                    Additionally, I have hands-on experience with <strong>TensorFlow</strong> for <strong>image processing and machine learning</strong>, particularly using the <strong>MNIST dataset</strong> for model training.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of coding, I enjoy participating in <strong>competitive programming, image processing projects, and full-stack development</strong>. 
                    I aim to build innovative applications that enhance user experience and solve real-world problems.
                </p>
